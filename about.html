        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi there! I’m [Name], a student chef currently studying at [Culinary School Name]. My culinary journey began with my family’s recipes, where I learned the joy of combining fresh ingredients and creating comfort through food. Over time, I developed a passion for cooking that has led me to pursue it as a career.</p>
        <p>With each class and hands-on experience, I’m discovering new techniques and exploring global cuisines. I’m particularly inspired by farm-to-table dining, sustainable cooking, and the art of plating. My goal is to blend traditional techniques with modern flavors to create dishes that are as beautiful as they are delicious.</p>
        <p>When I'm not in the kitchen, I love reading about food science, exploring new restaurants, and collecting cookbooks from around the world. Thank you for stopping by my portfolio, and I hope my work inspires you as much as it has inspired me!</p>
